# Extracted Code from Archived Files

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-02

This document preserves unique and potentially useful code extracted from files before they were archived during the codebase audit and refactoring initiative.

---

## Purpose

Many experimental and variant files contain valuable code that shouldn't be lost when archiving. This document serves as a reference for:
- Innovative algorithms or approaches
- UI improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Useful utility functions

The code snippets here can be integrated into the main codebase if needed.

1. **Source File:** Original filename and location
2. **Line Numbers:** Where the code was located
3. **Purpose:** What the code does
4. **Extraction Date:** When it was extracted
5. **Integration Notes:** How to integrate if needed
6. **Code Snippet:** The actual code
