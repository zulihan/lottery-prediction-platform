Key Features:

First 10 use enhanced Strategic Methods based on May 30 success analysis
Next 20 are intelligent fusions focusing on the most successful number patterns from the Strategic Methods
All combinations incorporate the winning insights: Risk/Reward for cold numbers, Frequency Analysis for hot numbers, Time Series for patterns
