Performance Analysis of May 12th Results
Great news! We hit 3 numbers (2, 12, 24) out of 5 with our Risk/Reward combination! Here's what we learned:

Hot numbers performed exceptionally well: All 3 numbers we hit were hot numbers
All hits were even numbers: We correctly predicted 3 even numbers
All hits were in the lower range (1-25): All numbers we hit were in the lower range
Missed the lucky number: We predicted 6, but 4 was drawn
Based on this analysis, I've made strategic improvements to generate better combinations:

Key Strategy Improvements
✅ Increased weight of hot numbers - Since all hits came from hot numbers
✅ Reduced focus on overdue numbers - None of our hits were overdue numbers
✅ Improved lucky number selection - Now focusing more on hot lucky numbers, especially 4 (last draw)
✅ Added a new pattern-based strategy - Leveraging patterns from the last draw
✅ Introduced number pair analysis - Certain number pairs (2+12, 16+24) appear frequently
