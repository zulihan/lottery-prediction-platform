Prompt for Creating an Advanced Euromillions Prediction Application
Context
I want to develop a sophisticated application that uses advanced statistical and mathematical methods to generate optimized combinations for Euromillions. This application should go beyond simple frequency analysis and integrate complex probabilistic models to maximize winning chances.
Available Data

CSV files containing the complete history of Euromillions draws since 2004
Draw format: 5 main numbers (1-50) and 2 star numbers (1-12)
Associated temporal metadata (dates, days of the week, etc.)

Required Features
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Automated import of historical data from different sources
Advanced data cleaning and validation
Optimized structuring for temporal analyses
Automatic updates after each new draw

2. Multi-dimensional Statistical Analysis

Weighted frequency analysis (recent/historical with 60/40 ratio)
Time series analysis to detect cyclical patterns
Markov models to study transitions between draws
Bayesian analysis to continuously update probabilities
Detection of systemic biases in draws (if they exist)
Analysis of recurring pairs and subsets of numbers

3. Grid Generation with Hybrid Approaches

Basic strategy: Optimized combinations of high-frequency numbers/stars
Mixed strategy: Statistically validated optimal mix between frequent numbers and outsiders
Temporal strategy: Selections based on identified temporal cycles and patterns
Stratified sampling strategy: Proportional selection from different strata of numbers
Systematic coverage strategy: Mathematical optimization to cover subsets of possibilities
Risk/reward optimization strategy: Identification of combinations with equal probability but potentially less played

4. Advanced User Interface and Visualization

Interactive dashboard with visualization of trends and patterns
Dynamic charts showing temporal evolutions of frequencies
Heatmaps of correlations between numbers and stars
Visualization of predictions with confidence intervals
Interface for customizing model parameters

5. Continuous Evaluation and Adaptation

Automated feedback systems after each draw
Performance metrics for different strategies
Learning algorithms to progressively refine models
A/B testing between different predictive approaches

Mathematical Methods to Implement
1. Rigorous Statistical Tests
Implementation of statistical tests (chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov) to verify the true uniformity of draws and identify potential anomalies.
2. Markov Chains
Modeling transitions between states (draws) to detect potential dependencies between successive draws:

Transition matrices between numbers
Analysis of temporal sequences with different windows

3. Bayesian Methods
Use of Bayesian inference to continuously update probabilities:

Definition of prior distributions based on long history
Updating distributions with recent data
Calculation of posterior probability distributions

4. Stratified Sampling
Division of the set of numbers into relevant strata:

By parity (even/odd)
By numerical ranges (1-10, 11-20, etc.)
By sum of digits
By spatial distribution on the grid

5. Analysis of Human Cognitive Biases
Identification and exploitation of human player tendencies:

Avoidance of frequently played combinations
Identification of statistically "under-played" numbers
Optimization of potential gain / probability ratio

Example of Mathematical Formula for Scoring
For a number i, calculate a composite score S(i) such that:
S(i) = α × F_r(i) + β × F_h(i) + γ × M(i) + δ × B(i) + ε × T(i)
Where:

F_r(i) = normalized recent frequency
F_h(i) = normalized historical frequency
M(i) = Markov score (based on transitions)
B(i) = Bayesian score (posterior probability)
T(i) = temporal component (identified cycles)
α, β, γ, δ, ε = optimized weighting coefficients

Expected Deliverable
A sophisticated application integrating these multiple mathematical and statistical approaches, capable of generating optimized grids according to different strategies, with an interface allowing users to visualize and understand the patterns identified in the data.
The application should be able to learn and adapt to each new draw, automatically adjusting model parameters to maximize predictive performance over the long term.
