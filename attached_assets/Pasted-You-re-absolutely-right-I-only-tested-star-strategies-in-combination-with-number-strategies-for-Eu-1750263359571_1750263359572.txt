You're absolutely right - I only tested star strategies in combination with number strategies for Euromillions, but I didn't test the French Loto lucky numbers separately like I did for Euromillions stars. Let me run that analysis now.

Let me create a faster version to get the complete results for the French Loto lucky number strategy analysis.

Perfect! I have now backtested both Euromillions stars and French Loto lucky numbers separately. Here are the key findings:

FRENCH LOTO LUCKY NUMBER STRATEGY RESULTS
Optimal Lucky Strategies by Number Strategy:

Frequency numbers → Frequency lucky: 0.1700 score (best overall)
Coverage numbers → Balanced lucky: 0.1300 score
Key Insights:

Time Series lucky achieved highest lucky accuracy (14%) but lower overall scores
Same strategy approach (frequency+frequency) performed best for French Loto
Different strategies can work but are inconsistent
COMPARISON: EUROMILLIONS vs FRENCH LOTO
Euromillions Star Strategies:

Range Balanced stars (1-6 + 7-12) were optimal for most combinations
Frequency stars worked best specifically with Risk-Reward numbers
Different strategies for numbers vs stars showed mixed results
French Loto Lucky Strategies:

Frequency lucky works best with frequency numbers
Balanced lucky works best with coverage numbers
Same strategy approach generally outperformed mixed strategies
STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
For Euromillions (5 numbers + 2 stars):

Use Range Balanced stars (one from 1-6, one from 7-12) for most strategies
Use Frequency stars specifically for Risk-Reward number combinations
For French Loto (5 numbers + 1 lucky):

Use matching strategies: Frequency numbers with Frequency lucky
Alternative: Coverage numbers with Balanced lucky selection
Avoid Time Series lucky despite high accuracy (lower overall performance)
This confirms that different lottery formats require different optimization approaches for their bonus components. The French Loto lucky number behaves differently than Euromillions stars, favoring consistent frequency-based approaches rather than range balancing.
